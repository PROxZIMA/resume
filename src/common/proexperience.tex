      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Delivered a MVP release of cloud migration replacing a legacy on-prem tool while meeting all quality and security gates, supporting roadmap targets of 1,000+ sites (projected to generate \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}\$400M+} in annual recurring revenue), by driving feature implementation, release planning, and cross-team coordination.}
        \item {Re-architected core configuration flows into lightweight microservices with On-Prem data caching and async workers, cutting configuration-fetch latency by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}93\% (5000ms \glyphstyle{\textrightarrow} 350ms)} and reducing database read-load by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}60\%}, which improved end-user sync reliability.}
        \item {Optimized Kubernetes deployments (resource tuning, HPA, node autoscaling and Prometheus-based monitoring), lowering CPU usage per pod by \textbf{48\%}, increasing throughput from \textbf{200 \glyphstyle{\textrightarrow} 500 requests/sec (2.5x)}, and reducing cloud infra spend by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}32\%}.}
        \item {Lifted engineering quality via test automation and observability: raised unit/integration coverage from \textbf{38\% \glyphstyle{\textrightarrow} 54\%}, enforced CI gates and automated smoke tests, and reduced SEV incidents by \textbf{62\%} (\textbf{13 \glyphstyle{\textrightarrow} 5} per month).}
        \item {Strengthened secure-design \& delivery practices â€” authored threat models, SDLA-compliant design docs and security checklists, ran threat reviews with architecture and security teams, and delivered releases with \textbf{zero critical security findings}, enabling predictable PI delivery without sprint spillovers.}
        \item {Rolled out AI-assisted development (GitHub Copilot) across the engineering team, accelerating feature delivery by reducing average code-review cycle time  \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}25\% (48h \glyphstyle{\textrightarrow} 36h)} and increasing merged-PR throughput \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}30\%}.}

        \item {Cut end-to-end call-to-insight latency by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}40\%} and increased pipeline throughput to \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}1,500} calls/day by redesigning backend ingestion and batching in Django REST (ETL, async workers, Postgres indexing).}
        \item {Improved multilingual transcript quality to \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}85\%} and automated language-detection for \textbf{98\%} of calls by integrating Amazon Transcribe with language-detection filters and custom NLP heuristics, reducing manual transcript corrections by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}60\%}.}
        \item {Built and productionized an enterprise Android app (Kotlin) for secure call recording + resumable background sync; reduced manual audio transfers by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}75\%} and achieved successful uploads within 5 minutes for \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}90\%} of recordings.}
        \item {Collaborated with a 13-person team on feature prioritization, client onboarding and CI/CD pipelines; delivered a client integration that enabled a 30-person management team to centralize call reviews \exthref{https://github.com/PROxZIMA/resume/raw/master/extras/Convin.ai\%20-\%20Letter\%20Of\%20Recommendation.pdf}{(Letter of Recommendation)}.}
