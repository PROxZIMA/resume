      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Contributed to the MVP release of cloud migration replacing a legacy on-prem tool, supporting roadmap targets of 1,000+ global sites and a major revenue stream, by driving feature implementation and cross-team coordination.}
        \item {Re-architected data workflows into \textbf{gRPC} microservices with On-Prem data caching and async workers, cutting data fetching latency by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}93\% (5000ms to 350ms)} and reducing database read-load by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}60\%}, improving end user reliability.}
        \item {Optimized Kubernetes deployments through resource tuning, Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), and Prometheus monitoring, lowering CPU usage per pod by \textbf{48\%}, increasing throughput by \textbf{2.5x (up to 500 requests/sec)}, and reducing cloud infra spend by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}32\%}.}
        \item {Improved system reliability by raising unit and integration test coverage from \textbf{38\% to 54\%} and enforcing CI/CD automated smoke tests, resulting in a \textbf{62\%} reduction in monthly SEV incidents (\textbf{13 to 5}).}
        \item {Strengthened secure-design \& delivery practices by authoring threat models, SDLA-compliant design docs and security checklists that ensured \textbf{zero critical security findings} across multiple releases, enabling predictable PI delivery without sprint spillovers.}
        \item {Led the internal rollout of AI-assisted development tools (GitHub Copilot) across the engineering team, accelerating feature delivery by reducing average code-review cycle time by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}25\% (48h to 36h)} and increasing merged-PR throughput by \textbf{\texttt{\char`\~}30\%}.}
